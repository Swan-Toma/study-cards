# Study Application
This is a flash cards application. See pictures folders for details.
I made this because I want my own flash cards application to study with.
Also, this is a personal project to practice using React and Node.js/Express.

# Flip Feature
The card will flip to the definition through a click. A 3D
transformation flip occurs after clicking the card.

# Tech Stack
client: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS<br />
